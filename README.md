# Task 4: Feature Encoding & Scaling

## Dataset
Adult Income Dataset (Kaggle)  
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wenruliu/adult-income-dataset

## Objective
To understand feature engineering concepts such as encoding categorical variables and scaling numerical features to prepare an ML-ready dataset.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Steps Performed
1. Loaded Adult Income dataset (CSV)
2. Identified categorical and numerical features
3. Applied Label Encoding where order exists (target variable)
4. Applied One-Hot Encoding where order does not exist
5. Scaled numerical features using StandardScaler
6. Compared data before and after scaling
7. Saved the processed dataset

## Feature Engineering Techniques
- Label Encoding
- One-Hot Encoding
- Feature Scaling (StandardScaler)

## Interview Concepts Covered
- Label Encoding vs One-Hot Encoding
- Importance of Feature Scaling
- Normalization
- Algorithms that require scaling
- Feature Engineering basics

## Deliverables
- Google Colab Notebook
- Preprocessed dataset (CSV)

## Outcome
Intern understands feature engineering fundamentals and can prepare datasets for machine learning models.
